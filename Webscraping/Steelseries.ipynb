      "[<span class=\"\">Hello, I bought Steelseries Rival 310 Wired Gaming Mouse from AdeksStore company via n11 website. After about 9, my product malfunctioned and I sent it to the company under warranty. The company sent the product it bought to the service provider teklos. This company informed me that the product will be refunded to me. The product is available in stock at the company I purchased it from. However, the authorized service says there is no product in stock. It is a product for sale. The current market value of the product is around 544 TL. My purchase price for the product is 369 TL. I see that the company has opportunistically left me a victim in a way that I cannot buy it in the market instead of giving neither a new nor a higher model of the product. I don't know if this policy of companies to deceive their customers and leave them victims is right or wrong. I conveyed to the company that I wanted a new or higher model of the product that I am entitled to, if any, but an indifferent and irrelevant attitude made me very sad. After my first sending, I did not return the product, I sent the product back to the warranty after 2 months, unfortunately the situation is still the same, the price of the products increased on time, and it is sad that the end users are affected in this way. We are saddened by the fact that this company has a service operation that does not suit the name of this company. I still have my product, I cannot return it, unfortunately I am not in a position to buy a new one.</span>]\n",

      "[<span class=\"\">Hello, I bought Steelseries Rival 310 Wired Gaming Mouse from AdeksStore company via n11 website. After about 9, my product malfunctioned and I sent it to the company under warranty. The company sent the product it bought to the service provider teklos. This company informed me that the product will be refunded to me. The product is available in stock at the company I purchased it from. However, the authorized service says there is no product in stock. It is a product for sale. The current market value of the product is around 544 TL. My purchase price for the product is 369 TL. I see that the company has opportunistically left me a victim in a way that I cannot buy it in the market instead of giving neither a new nor a higher model of the product. I don't know if this policy of companies to deceive their customers and leave them victims is right or wrong. I conveyed to the company that I wanted a new or higher model of the product that I am entitled to, if any, but an indifferent and irrelevant attitude made me very sad. After my first sending, I did not return the product, I sent the product back to the warranty after 2 months, unfortunately the situation is still the same, the price of the products increased on time, and it is sad that the end users are affected in this way. We are saddened by the fact that this company has a service operation that does not suit the name of this company. I still have my product, I cannot return it, unfortunately I am not in a position to buy a new one.</span>]\n",

      "[<span class=\"\">Hello, I bought Steelseries Rival 310 Wired Gaming Mouse from AdeksStore company via n11 website. After about 9, my product malfunctioned and I sent it to the company under warranty. The company sent the product it bought to the service provider teklos. This company informed me that the product will be refunded to me. The product is available in stock at the company I purchased it from. However, the authorized service says there is no product in stock. It is a product for sale. The current market value of the product is around 544 TL. My purchase price for the product is 369 TL. I see that the company has opportunistically left me a victim in a way that I cannot buy it in the market instead of giving neither a new nor a higher model of the product. I don't know if this policy of companies to deceive their customers and leave them victims is right or wrong. I conveyed to the company that I wanted a new or higher model of the product that I am entitled to, if any, but an indifferent and irrelevant attitude made me very sad. After my first sending, I did not return the product, I sent the product back to the warranty after 2 months, unfortunately the situation is still the same, the price of the products increased on time, and it is sad that the end users are affected in this way. We are saddened by the fact that this company has a service operation that does not suit the name of this company. I still have my product, I cannot return it, unfortunately I am not in a position to buy a new one.</span>]\n",

      "[<span class=\"\">Hello, I bought Steelseries Rival 310 Wired Gaming Mouse from AdeksStore company via n11 website. After about 9, my product malfunctioned and I sent it to the company under warranty. The company sent the product it bought to the service provider teklos. This company informed me that the product will be refunded to me. The product is available in stock at the company I purchased it from. However, the authorized service says there is no product in stock. It is a product for sale. The current market value of the product is around 544 TL. My purchase price for the product is 369 TL. I see that the company has opportunistically left me a victim in a way that I cannot buy it in the market instead of giving neither a new nor a higher model of the product. I don't know if this policy of companies to deceive their customers and leave them victims is right or wrong. I conveyed to the company that I wanted a new or higher model of the product that I am entitled to, if any, but an indifferent and irrelevant attitude made me very sad. After my first sending, I did not return the product, I sent the product back to the warranty after 2 months, unfortunately the situation is still the same, the price of the products increased on time, and it is sad that the end users are affected in this way. We are saddened by the fact that this company has a service operation that does not suit the name of this company. I still have my product, I cannot return it, unfortunately I am not in a position to buy a new one.</span>]\n",

      "[<span class=\"\">Hello, I bought Steelseries Rival 310 Wired Gaming Mouse from AdeksStore company via n11 website. After about 9, my product malfunctioned and I sent it to the company under warranty. The company sent the product it bought to the service provider teklos. This company informed me that the product will be refunded to me. The product is available in stock at the company I purchased it from. However, the authorized service says there is no product in stock. It is a product for sale. The current market value of the product is around 544 TL. My purchase price for the product is 369 TL. I see that the company has opportunistically left me a victim in a way that I cannot buy it in the market instead of giving neither a new nor a higher model of the product. I don't know if this policy of companies to deceive their customers and leave them victims is right or wrong. I conveyed to the company that I wanted a new or higher model of the product that I am entitled to, if any, but an indifferent and irrelevant attitude made me very sad. After my first sending, I did not return the product, I sent the product back to the warranty after 2 months, unfortunately the situation is still the same, the price of the products increased on time, and it is sad that the end users are affected in this way. We are saddened by the fact that this company has a service operation that does not suit the name of this company. I still have my product, I cannot return it, unfortunately I am not in a position to buy a new one.</span>]\n",
