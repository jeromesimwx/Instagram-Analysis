      "Exciting news!! 🤩 The brand new B560 motherboards for Intel builds have arrived, and having tested them hands on at our labs, these boards are an absolute must have if you\\'re considering an i5 based custom PC (or i7 10700F for that matter!).<br/><br/>With support for high speed memory, such as 3200mhz or 3600mhz modules, the B560 boards will allow you to pair an i5 10400F, 10600KF or i7 10700F with fast memory, resulting in better gaming performance (up to 5% in some of our tests!). Last generation B460 and H410 boards are LOCKED at 2666mhz when paired with an i5 chip, or 2933mhz with higher end chips, even when if you are using a high speed RAM modules. <br/><br/>So if you\\'re considering an i5 10400F or 10600KF for your next PC build, do keep the B560 board in mind!<br/><br/>The B560 and Z590 board options are now available for customisation with any AFTERSHOCK PC, and we\\'ve also upgraded our INTEL based ready to ship builds with B560 boards, making them fair superior to the other Intel based, H410 and B460 builds - with superior RAM speeds and gaming performance!<br/><br/>Custom PCs, Built To Perfection:<br/>www.aftershockpc.com<br/><br/><a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/aftershockpc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#aftershockpc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/custompc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#custompc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/yourrigyourchoice/\" tabindex=\"0\">#yourrigyourchoice</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/b560/\" tabindex=\"0\">#b560</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/z590/\" tabindex=\"0\">#z590</a>\n",

Last generation B460 and H410 boards are LOCKED at 2666mhz when paired with an i5 chip, or 2933mhz with higher end chips, even when if you are using a high speed RAM modules. <br/><br/>So if you\\'re considering an i5 10400F or 10600KF for your next PC build, do keep the B560 board in mind!<br/><br/>The B560 and Z590 board options are now available for customisation with any AFTERSHOCK PC, and we\\'ve also upgraded our INTEL based ready to ship builds with B560 boards, making them fair superior to the other Intel based, H410 and B460 builds - with superior RAM speeds and gaming performance!<br/><br/>Custom PCs, Built To Perfection:<br/>www.aftershockpc.com<br/><br/><a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/aftershockpc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#aftershockpc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/custompc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#custompc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/yourrigyourchoice/\" tabindex=\"0\">#yourrigyourchoice</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/b560/\" tabindex=\"0\">#b560</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/z590/\" tabindex=\"0\">#z590</a>\n",

Last generation B460 and H410 boards are LOCKED at 2666mhz when paired with an i5 chip, or 2933mhz with higher end chips, even when if you are using a high speed RAM modules. <br/><br/>So if you\\'re considering an i5 10400F or 10600KF for your next PC build, do keep the B560 board in mind!<br/><br/>The B560 and Z590 board options are now available for customisation with any AFTERSHOCK PC, and we\\'ve also upgraded our INTEL based ready to ship builds with B560 boards, making them fair superior to the other Intel based, H410 and B460 builds - with superior RAM speeds and gaming performance!<br/><br/>Custom PCs, Built To Perfection:<br/>www.aftershockpc.com<br/><br/><a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/aftershockpc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#aftershockpc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/custompc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#custompc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/yourrigyourchoice/\" tabindex=\"0\">#yourrigyourchoice</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/b560/\" tabindex=\"0\">#b560</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/z590/\" tabindex=\"0\">#z590</a>\n",

Last generation B460 and H410 boards are LOCKED at 2666mhz when paired with an i5 chip, or 2933mhz with higher end chips, even when if you are using a high speed RAM modules. <br/><br/>So if you\\'re considering an i5 10400F or 10600KF for your next PC build, do keep the B560 board in mind!<br/><br/>The B560 and Z590 board options are now available for customisation with any AFTERSHOCK PC, and we\\'ve also upgraded our INTEL based ready to ship builds with B560 boards, making them fair superior to the other Intel based, H410 and B460 builds - with superior RAM speeds and gaming performance!<br/><br/>Custom PCs, Built To Perfection:<br/>www.aftershockpc.com<br/><br/><a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/aftershockpc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#aftershockpc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/custompc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#custompc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/yourrigyourchoice/\" tabindex=\"0\">#yourrigyourchoice</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/b560/\" tabindex=\"0\">#b560</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/z590/\" tabindex=\"0\">#z590</a>\n",

Last generation B460 and H410 boards are LOCKED at 2666mhz when paired with an i5 chip, or 2933mhz with higher end chips, even when if you are using a high speed RAM modules. <br/><br/>So if you\\'re considering an i5 10400F or 10600KF for your next PC build, do keep the B560 board in mind!<br/><br/>The B560 and Z590 board options are now available for customisation with any AFTERSHOCK PC, and we\\'ve also upgraded our INTEL based ready to ship builds with B560 boards, making them fair superior to the other Intel based, H410 and B460 builds - with superior RAM speeds and gaming performance!<br/><br/>Custom PCs, Built To Perfection:<br/>www.aftershockpc.com<br/><br/><a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/aftershockpc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#aftershockpc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/custompc/\" tabindex=\"0\">#custompc</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/yourrigyourchoice/\" tabindex=\"0\">#yourrigyourchoice</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/b560/\" tabindex=\"0\">#b560</a> <a class=\"xil3i\" href=\"/explore/tags/z590/\" tabindex=\"0\">#z590</a>\n",
